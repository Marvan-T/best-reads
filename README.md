# Best Reads

"Best Reads" is a web application that was originally developed as a final year group project at
university. Our aim is to enhance the book discovery experience for users. This repository is a fork
of the original project, which I maintain, and includes an extension layer that adds new features to
the project.

- Original Project
  Repository: [Best Reads](https://github.com/laurenmaylittle-cs/book-recommendations)
- Extension Project: [Best Reads Extesions](https://github.com/Marvan-T/bestreads-extensions)

## Deployment

The project is deployed on Azure. You can visit the application using either of the following URLs:

- Main URL: [Best Reads](https://best-reads.live)
- Alternative URL: [Best Reads on Azure](https://best-reads.azurewebsites.net)
